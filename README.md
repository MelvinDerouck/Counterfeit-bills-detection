## Project Overview:
This project focuses on deploying an algorithm for detecting counterfeit banknotes based on dimensional data (6 metrics) of the bills. The dataset was divided into two parts, one labeled as genuine (True) and the other as counterfeit (False), enabling the assessment of authenticity. Various machine learning techniques were employed for data preprocessing and predictive analysis.

## Methods Used:
 -**Multiple Linear Regression and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors)**:
Utilized for imputing missing values in the dataset.

- **Logistic Regression and k-Means with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
Applied for predictive analysis and classification of results.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to banknote authenticity detection, integrating various machine learning techniques for preprocessing and predictive analysis. The combination of regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction contributes to a robust and accurate model for distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit banknotes.
